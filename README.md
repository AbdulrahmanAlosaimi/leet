# LeetCode Problem Solutions

I created this repo for personal use, to store my leetcode solutions. My leetcode profile can be found [here](https://leetcode.com/AbdulrahmanMO/)

It should be regularly updated whenever I solve a problem.

Languages that will be used:

- Java
- Python
- C++
- JavaScript/TypeScript

> Note: This is not a comprehensive list of the problems I solved.

> Note: The solutions aren't perfect, but I'm probably still working on it, and it is a WIP. Always learning something new and applying it.

### TODO
- Write script that given a problem link, generates a MD file corresponding to that problem's description
