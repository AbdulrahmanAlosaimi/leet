You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`.

Merge the two lists into one **sorted** list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return _the head of the merged linked list._

**Example 1:**

![merge_ex1](https://github.com/AbdulrahmanAlosaimi/leet/assets/76831852/ab073402-9a65-4446-bf45-8076170511ca)

> **Input:** list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]<br>**Output:** [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4]

**Example 2:**

> **Input:** list1 = [], list2 = []<br>**Output:** []

**Example 3:**

> **Input:** list1 = [], list2 = [0]<br>**Output:** [0]

**Constraints**:

- The number of nodes in both lists is in the range `[0, 50]`
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- Both `list1` and `list2` are sorted in **non-decreasing** order.
